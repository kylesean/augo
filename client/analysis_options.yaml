# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
  # and their documentation is published at https://dart.dev/lints.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.
  rules:
    always_use_package_imports: false

    # ============================================================
    # Strict rules for better code quality (enable progressively)
    # Uncomment these after cleaning up existing warnings

    # avoid_print: false  # Uncomment to disable the `avoid_print` rule
    # prefer_single_quotes: true  # Uncomment to enable the `prefer_single_quotes` rule

  # Exclude auto-generated files from analysis
  # These files are machine-generated and should not be manually edited
  exclude:
    - '**/*.g.dart'           # json_serializable, riverpod_generator
    - '**/*.freezed.dart'     # freezed
    - '**/*.gen.dart'         # other generators
    - 'lib/i18n/strings*.dart' # slang i18n generated files

  # Error severity configuration
  # Only ignore errors that are unavoidable due to code generation patterns
  errors:
    # invalid_annotation_target: Freezed uses annotations that may trigger this
    # This is safe to ignore as Freezed handles it correctly
